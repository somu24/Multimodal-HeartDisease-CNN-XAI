# Multimodal-HeartDisease-CNN-XAI
This repository contains a project for detecting cardiovascular diseases using a multimodal approach that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy for conditions such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, and valve disease by combining the analysis of medical images (X-rays and ECG signals) with patient information (medical history and symptoms).

## Key Features:
Multimodal Data Integration: Utilizes CNNs for medical image analysis and logistic regression for processing textual patient information.
Explainable AI: Implements LIME to ensure transparency and trust in the modelâ€™s predictions.
High Diagnostic Accuracy: Enhances accuracy by combining deep learning and XAI for various heart conditions.
Comprehensive Analysis: Integrates different data types for a holistic diagnostic approach, leading to earlier interventions and improved patient outcomes.

## Datasets
1. [NIH Chest X-ray Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data)
2. [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database] (https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
3. [UCI Heart Disease Dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
  
This project combines advanced deep learning and XAI techniques to revolutionize heart disease detection and prediction, providing healthcare professionals with accurate, transparent, and trustworthy diagnostic tools.
